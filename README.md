# AMATH_582

This repository contains all the code I created for my assignments in AMATH 582, taken at the University of Washington during winter quarter (January-March) 2021. Topics covered include Fourier analysis, principal component analysis, machine learning, and dynamic mode decomposition. All code is implemented in MATLAB.
